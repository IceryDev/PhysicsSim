## Running Games

- To run built-in games, you have to copy the contents of the .txt file into the appropriate .pde file in the main folder.
- Processing otherwise will not recognise the required library files (Collision, Kinematics, Shape, etc.) if they are not in the same folder.

- The Ping Pong game is not compatible with the current version of the game engine as most functionality has been changed. I will post it as a new branch when possible.
