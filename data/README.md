## Space Invader Game:

- This is an example space invader game made using this game engine (I guess I have to find a better name than PhysicsSim).
- It uses Processing standard sound library, which you'll have to enable through Processing's own interface (even if you are using the VS Code plugin, to enable the library you have to go to Processing).
- To download the library, go to Tools/Manage Tools/Libraries from the above bar interface and search "sound".
- Download the library authored by the Processing developers.

- All the sprites are drawn by me (IceryDev) (I did my best :) )
- Sound effects are created using the website https://sfxr.me/
